** GAMEPLAY

Circles will appear on the screen and start constantly expanding.
If there is a point where the circles can no longer expand, you lose the game
(the screen bursts/explodes/cracks)

To prevent this, the player must tap (frenetically) the circles. Each time he 
taps, the circle reduce in size. When a circle reduces below a certain size,
it vanishes.

Circles may start with different sizes and have different speeds of growth.

The game is divided into levels.
    - Each level last 20 / 30 seconds
    - As the level progress, the number of circles that appear increases, as their
        speed of growth (in average).
    - * At the end of the level, there is a "slot machine" that unleashes good or
        bad things for the next level. Ex:
            - Slower circles
            - Faster circles
            - Increase in tap power (tap reduces more in the circles)
            - More circles
            - etc..
    - * Powerups
        Appear with the "slot machine" or by themselves:
            - Chill Bomb - Reduces speed of circle grown for a time.
            - Black Hole - Reduces surrounding circles. 
                (limited uses / one time use & time dependant)
            - etc
    - Scoring: You score points for each circle eliminated equal to *the maximum size 
        it reached*. This gives a "push your luck" aspect to the game.
